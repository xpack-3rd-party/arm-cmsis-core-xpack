# A source code library with Arm CMSIS Core

This project provides the **CMSIS Core** headers as an xPack dependency.

The project is hosted on GitHub as
[xpack-3rd-party/arm-cmsis-core-xpack](https://github.com/xpack-3rd-party/arm-cmsis-core-xpack).

## Maintainer info

This page is addressed to developers who plan to include this source
library into their own projects.

For maintainer info, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER-XPACK](README-MAINTAINER-XPACK.md) file.

## Install

As a source library xPack, the easiest way to add it to a project is via
**xpm**, but it can also be used as any Git project, for example as a submodule.

### Prerequisites

A recent [xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/),
which is a portable [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) command line application.

It is recommended to update to the latest version with:

```sh
npm install --global xpm@latest
```

For details please follow the instructions in the
[xPack install](https://xpack.github.io/install/) page.

### xpm

This package is available as
[`@xpack-3rd-party/arm-cmsis-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-3rd-party/arm-cmsis-core)
from the `npmjs.com` registry:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Unless a package.json is already present

xpm install @xpack-3rd-party/arm-cmsis-core@latest

ls -l xpacks/@xpack-3rd-party/arm-cmsis-core
```

### Git submodule

If, for any reason, **xpm** is not available, the next recommended
solution is to link it as a Git submodule below an `xpacks` folder.

```sh
cd my-project
git init # Unless already a Git project
mkdir -p xpacks

git submodule add https://github.com/xpack-3rd-party/arm-cmsis-core-xpack.git \
  xpacks/@micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus
```

## Branches

There are three active branches:

- `master`, follows the original Arm `master`
- `xpack`, with the latest stable version (default)
- `xpack-develop`, with the current development version

All development is done in the `xpack-develop` branch, and contributions via
Pull Requests should be directed to this branch. (Only contributions
related to the xPack integration are accepted, functional contributions
should be addressed to the upstream project.)

When new releases are published, the `xpack-develop` branch is merged
into `xpack`.

## Developer info

### Overview

This package provides the full CMSIS_5 code, but when
installed via xpm the content is filtered and only the
CMSIS Core files are used.

In addition to the source files, the
configuration files required to integrate it into
CMake and meson projects, via a CMake INTERFACE library, or
a meson dependency.

### Status

The **arm-cmsis-core** source library is fully functional.

### Build & integration info

The headers are written in C, but can also be used in C++ projects.

To include this package in a project, consider the following details.

#### Include folders

For Cortex-M, the following folders should be used during the build:

- `CMSIS/Core/Include`

The header files can then be included in user projects with statements like:

```c++
#include <core_cm4.h>
```

Similarly for Cortex-A:

- `CMSIS/Core_A/Include`

```c++
#include <core_ca.h>
```

#### Source files

- none

#### Preprocessor definitions

When including the `core_cm*.h`, the following definitions are expected:

- `__CM0_REV`, `__CM0PLUS_REV`, `__CM3_REV`, `__CM4_REV`, `__CM7_REV`
- `__MPU_PRESENT`
- `__NVIC_PRIO_BITS`
- `__FPU_PRESENT`
- `__Vendor_SysTickConfig`

When including the `core_ca.h`, the following definitions are expected:

- `__CORTEX_A`
- `__CA_REV`
- `__FPU_PRESENT`
- `__GIC_PRESENT`
- `__TIM_PRESENT`
- `__L2C_PRESENT`

Note: the Cortex-A support seems to cover only a small number of
32-bit devices and the quality is debatable.

#### CMake

To integrate the CMSIS Core headers into a CMake application,
add this folder to the build:

```cmake
add_subdirectory("xpacks/@xpack-3rd-party/arm-cmsis-core")`
```

The result is an INTERFACE library that can be added
as a dependency with:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(your-target PRIVATE
  ...
  xpack-3rd-party::arm-cmsis-core
)
```

#### meson

To integrate the CMSIS Core headers into a meson application,
add this folder to the build:

```meson
subdir('xpacks/@xpack-3rd-party/arm-cmsis-core')
```

The result is an object that can be added
as a dependency with:

```meson
exe = executable(
  your-target,

  dependencies: [
    xpack_3rd_party_arm_cmsis_core_dependency,
  ],
)
```

### Example

The CMSIS Core headers are not intended for end-user consumption, but by
vendor, to include them in their specific device headers.

### Known problems

- the headers, especially the Core_A, may trigger warnings.

### Tests

TBD

## Further Planned Enhancements
 - CMSIS-Pack:
   - System Description SDF Format: describe more complex debug topologies than with a Debug Description in a tool agnostic way
   - CPDSC project file format: allows project templates that are agnostic of an IDE
   - Minimize need for IDE specific settings: CMSIS-Pack supports IDE specific parameters. Analyze and minimize
 - CMSIS-Build: command-line driven make system for CMSIS-Pack based projects (to support CI tests)

## Generate CMSIS Pack for Release

This GitHub development repository contains already pre-built libraries (stored in Git-LFS) of various software components (DSP, RTOS, RTOS2).
These libraries are validated for release. Git-LFS needs to be installed to retrieve the actual binary files, please see https://git-lfs.github.com/.

To build a complete CMSIS pack for installation the following additional tools are required:
 - **doxygen.exe**    Version: 1.8.6 (Documentation Generator)
 - **mscgen.exe**     Version: 0.20  (Message Sequence Chart Converter)
 - **7z.exe (7-Zip)** Version: 16.02 (File Archiver)

Using these tools, you can generate on a Windows PC:
 - **CMSIS Documentation** using the batch file **gen_doc.sh** (located in ./CMSIS/Doxygen).
 - **CMSIS Software Pack** using the batch file **gen_pack.sh** (located in ./CMSIS/Utilities).
   The bash script does not generate the documentation. The pre-built libraries for RTX4 and RTX5
   are not included within this repository.

The file ./CMSIS/DoxyGen/How2Doc.txt describes the rules for creating API documentation.
